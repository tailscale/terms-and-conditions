    1. _Tailscale Indemnities._

       1. Tailscale will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Customer, and its officers, directors, employees and agents (each, a “**Customer Indemnitee**”) from and against any and all Losses incurred by a Customer Indemnitees arising out of or relating to any claim, action, demand, inquiry, audit, proceeding, or investigation of any nature, civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory, or other, whether at law, in equity or otherwise (collectively, an “**Action**”) by a third party (other than an Affiliate of an Tailscale Indemnitee) that arise from or relate to any allegation that the Tailscale Solution infringe any third-party Intellectual Property Right in Canada or the United States. The foregoing obligation does not apply to any Action or Losses arising out of or relating to any: (A) incorporation of any of the Tailscale Solution into, or any combination, operation, or use of the Tailscale Solution with, any products or services not provided or authorized by Tailscale, unless such infringement would also have resulted solely from the use of the Tailscale Solution without their incorporation in, or combination, operation or use, with such other products or services; (B) modification of the Tailscale Solution other than by Tailscale or with Tailscale’s express written approval; or (C) unauthorized use of the Tailscale Solution.

       1. If the Tailscale Solution is, or in Tailscale’s opinion is likely to be, claimed to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party Intellectual Property Right, or if Customer’s use of any portion of the Tailscale Solution is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, Tailscale may, at its option and sole cost and expense:

          1. obtain the right for Customer to continue to use the affected portion of the Tailscale Solution materially as contemplated by this Agreement;

          1. modify or replace Tailscale Solution, in whole or in part, to seek to make the Tailscale Solution (as so modified or replaced) non-infringing while providing materially equivalent features and functionality, in which case such modifications or replacements will constitute Tailscale Solution under this Agreement; or

          1. if Tailscale determines that neither of the foregoing two options are reasonably available, by written notice to Customer, terminate this Agreement and require Customer to immediately cease all use of the Tailscale Solution or part or feature thereof.

    1. _Customer Indemnities._ Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Tailscale, and its officers, directors, employees and agents (each, a “**Tailscale Indemnitee**”) from and against any and all Losses incurred by Tailscale Indemnitees arising out of or relating to any Action by a third party (other than an Affiliate of an Tailscale Indemnitee) that arise from or relate to: (i) Customer Data; (ii) Customer’s breach of Sections 2.3, 10.1, or 14.4; or (iii) unauthorized use of the Tailscale Solution (or any part thereof) by Customer or any Permitted User.

    1. _Indemnification Procedure._ Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing of any Action for which such Party believes it is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 11. The Party seeking indemnification (the “**Indemnitee**”) will cooperate with the other Party (the “**Indemnitor**”) at the Indemnitor’s sole cost and expense. The Indemnitor will promptly take control of the defense and investigation of such Action and will employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnitor’s sole cost and expense. The Indemnitee’s failure to perform any obligations under this Section 11.3 will not relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnity obligations under this Section 11, except to the extent that the Indemnitor can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnitee may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing.
