Education technology companies are not eligible. Schools and programs for students who are under 18 years of age are not eligible. 


2.	**Representations, Warranties and Covenants.** In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants in the Terms or MSA (as applicable to you), you further represent, warrant and covenant that: (a) you meet the eligibility criteria associated with your Plan discount, and are able to provide proof if asked; and (b) you will promptly notify Tailscale of any material changes to your status that may impact your eligibility for a Plan discount. 


3.	**Disclaimer.** As a reminder, for education organizations based in the United States, Tailscale does not act as a “school official” as defined under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and similar state and federal laws, and you are solely responsible for using the Tailscale Solution only for non-FERPA covered purposes.
