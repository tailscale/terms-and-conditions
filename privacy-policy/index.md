research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide
certain features to you. To prevent Segment Analytics from using your

**ONLINE ADVERTISING.** In using the Site, we allow select third party

technologies on the browser of your device to collect information about

content and advertising to you as you browse the Internet, and access
their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your browser to
assist in this activity. If you are interested in more information about
these online advertising activities, and how you can generally control
cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising,
you may visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance of
Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/choices), [Network Advertising
Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
link](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/),
the [Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out
link](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/), or [Your Online
Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) to opt-out of
receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
programs.

We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company
chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible
for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. Please note that if you
use these mechanisms, you may still see advertising on the Internet, but
it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in
certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful
choices about the information collected on our Services for third party
purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms
listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to
