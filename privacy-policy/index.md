### Information we maintain on behalf of our Customers<a name="info"></a>

The Tailscale Service allows our Customers to directly connect servers, computers, mobile devices, and cloud instances in a simple mesh network, in which every connection is encrypted. To provide this product to our Customers, we collect, use, and disclose personal information of individuals, including employees of our Customers. The personal information we collect, use, and disclose includes business contact information such as names, job titles, and company email addresses, as well as information about individual devices (such as device hardware and operating system) and aggregated usage statistics (such as amount of data transmitted in a period of time).

We collect and use information only on behalf of our Customers, and do not use such information for any other purpose except as set out in this privacy policy or as required or permitted by applicable laws.

We rely on our Customers to comply with laws applicable to them (including privacy laws) when using the Tailscale Service to collect, use, or disclose personal information of individuals, including, where applicable, by obtaining appropriate consent to collect, use, and disclose personal information.

### How we collect and use personal information<a name="collect"></a>

**To create and administer your account:** You do not have to create a Tailscale account to visit our website or download our client applications. However, you will be required to create an account in order to use the Tailscale Service. To create and administer your account, we will collect information such as your email address, as well as your first and last name. We will ask you to authenticate, using your email address, with your domain’s corresponding OAuth2 or SAML provider. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (such as letters, phone calls or email messages). If you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account, you are required to notify us immediately.

We may offer Customers or their permitted users (such as employees or contractors) the opportunity to engage with or log into the Tailscale Service using third-party social networking sites or other third-party applications. When you log into our product through these third-party sites, we may collect certain information associated with your account on the third party’s site (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture, gender) in order to create and manage your account, or as part of the operation of the third party’s website, plug-in or application.

**To provide the Tailscale Service:** We collect information about our Customers’ use of the Tailscale Service, including information about each device used (such as the type of device hardware, hostname, all IP addresses, internal and private network routing information, operating system version, cryptographic public key, user agent (where applicable), the version of the Tailscale software installed, aggregate usage information (such as timestamps and connection logs between devices, as well as the sum of data transferred between devices by a given user), language settings, and the date and time the app accesses our servers). We use this information to provide, monitor, and manage the quality of our services, as well as to provide technical assistance. In some cases, The Tailscale Service uses this information to assist in establishing connections between pairs of devices. However, because transmissions through the Tailscale Service are encrypted, we do not collect, use, or disclose, and do not have access to, the personal information transmitted by our Customers through the network (with the exception of log files you may choose to send to Tailscale). Therefore, while we may collect information about the amount of data transferred by a user, we are not able to access or view the content of that data.

**To book a demo:** If you apply for a free consultation, demo, event, webinar, or other offer, we may collect your name, job title, and business contact information (including company email and phone number), and certain information about your company and devices. We use this information to contact you and otherwise facilitate or provide you with your consultation or demo.

**To send marketing communications:** If you sign-up to receive email marketing communications such as newsletters, we collect your email address as well as other information on an optional basis to help us tailor our communications to you. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included at the bottom of each email. Alternatively, you can opt-out of receiving email marketing communications by contacting us at the contact information provided in the “Contact us” section below. Please note that you may continue to receive transactional or account-related communications from us.

If you choose to provide us with your email, we may also submit your email to third-party social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google or LinkedIn for the purpose of displaying targeted advertisements to you on these platforms. You can manage your privacy settings directly through your account on these third-party platforms, including by opting out of targeted advertising.

**To conduct surveys and customer research:** From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys. We use this information to help us understand our users and to enhance our website, client app, and the Tailscale Service.

**To process your application for employment:** If you apply for a job with us, we may collect certain personal information about you (such as information that would be contained in a resume, cover letter, or other employment-related materials). We use this information for the purpose of processing and responding to your application.

**To provide customer support:** When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint through email, or telephone, or online chat, you may be asked for information that identifies you, such as your name, email address, and a telephone number, along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment. We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and service offerings.

We may monitor and record our telephone conversations with you for training and quality assurance purposes. You will be provided with a notice at the beginning of any call that is being recorded. If you do not wish to have your call recorded, please let us know.

### How we share personal information<a name="share"></a>

We do not sell or disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as set forth below or as required or permitted by law.

**Service providers:** Your personal information will be transferred (or otherwise made available) to certain third parties that provide services on our behalf. We use service providers to provide services such as hosting the website, operating certain of its features, processing payments, providing authentication services, data analysis to better understand and improve product and website usage, and providing advertising and marketing services. Our service providers are only provided with the information they need to perform their designated functions and are not authorized to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes. Our service providers may be located in the U.S., Canada or other foreign jurisdictions.

**Legal and compliance:** We and our Canadian, U.S. and other foreign service providers may provide your personal information in response to a search warrant to other legally valid inquiry or order, or to another organization for the purposes of investigating a breach of an agreement or contravention of law or detecting, suppressing or preventing fraud, or as otherwise may be required or permitted by applicable Canadian, U.S. or other law or legal process, which may include lawful access by U.S. or foreign courts, law enforcement or other government authorities. Your personal information may also be disclosed where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and to investigate or prevent actual or suspected loss or harm to persons or property.

**Sale of business:** We may transfer any information we have about you as an asset in connection with a proposed or completed merger, acquisition or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of Tailscale Inc. or as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control.

### Information about our website and applications<a name="about"></a>

**Visiting our website:** In general, you can visit our website without telling us who you are or submitting any personal information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our website and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system, and average time spent on our website. We use this information to help us understand our website activity and to monitor and improve our website.

**Cookies:** Our website uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our website sends to a user’s browser, which may then be stored on the user’s hard drive and later retrieved by our website so that, for instance, we can recognize the user’s computer or device when they return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from our website, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the website features.

**Website analytics:** The website also uses web analytics services such as Segment Analytics. Segment helps us analyze how visitors use the website. The information generated by your use of the website (including your IP address) will be used for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. You can prevent the storage and processing of data relating to your use of the website by using the Segment consent management tool by emailing us at the contact information below.

**App usage information & analytics:** As with many applications, certain limited data is required for our client software to function on your device. This data includes the type of device hardware, hostname, all IP addresses, internal and private network routing information, operating system version, cryptographic public key, user agent (where applicable), the version of the Tailscale software installed, aggregate usage information (such as timestamps and connection logs between devices, as well as the sum of data transferred between devices by a given user), language settings, and the date and time the app accesses our servers. To use the Tailscale Service on your device, we also require that you authenticate (using your email address) against a third-party identity provider; your email address will be associated by us with your device. We use this information to help us understand the activity on our client app, to monitor and improve our app, and to tailor your in-app experience. In addition, we may use third party service providers to collect analytical information about your use of our client app, such as the features used and time spent on the app, to help us tailor your in-app experience, improve the Tailscale Service and the quality of our app, and to better understand our users.

**Interest-Based Advertising:** We work with third-parties such as ad networks, service providers, and other advertising companies that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our website in order to provide you with tailored advertisements across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our website and third-party websites (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites. This information may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.

**Opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising:** For more information about interest-based advertising and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioral ads from third-party advertising companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at https://youradchoices.ca/choices.

Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes, including analytics, and you will still see ads from us. However, the ads will not be targeted based on behavioral information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.

To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser’s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them). Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser’s saved cookies, you will need to opt-out again.

**Third party links:** Our website may contain links to other websites that Tailscale does not own or operate. We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, notices and terms of use. We do not have any control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

### Safeguards and Retention<a name="safeguards"></a>

We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures in an effort to safeguard the personal information in our custody and control against theft, loss and unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure. We restrict access to personal information on a need-to-know basis to employees and authorized service providers who require access to fulfill their job requirements.

We have record retention processes designed to retain personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out herein or as otherwise required to meet legal or business requirements. Thereafter, we either securely delete or de-identify any personal information. To request your personal information be deleted, contact <support@tailscale.com>.

### Access to Information<a name="access"></a>

Subject to applicable law, you have the right to access, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information in our custody or control. You may request access, updating and corrections of inaccuracies in your personal information in our custody or control by emailing or writing to us at the contact information set out below. We may request certain personal information for the purpose of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access to his or her personal information records.

Please note that information transmitted by our Customers through the Tailscale Service is encrypted, and not accessible by us (except for log files you may choose to send to us). If you wish to access personal information being processed by one of our Customers, please contact that Customer directly.
