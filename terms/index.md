        all Fees are identified in US dollars and are payable in
        advance within thirty days of receipt of an invoice from
        Tailscale. If Customer's use of the Tailscale Solution exceeds
        the service capacity set forth in an Order Form or otherwise
        requires the payment of additional fees pursuant to the terms
        of the Agreement, Customer will be billed for such usage and
        Customer will pay the additional fees in accordance with the
        Agreement.

    8.2.  *Free Trial.* Upon Customer's request, Tailscale may provide
        Customer with a free trial of the Tailscale Solution for the
        period set by Tailscale in writing. Near to or upon the
        expiration date of the free trial, Tailscale will notify
        Customer that the trial will be ending or has ended. Customer
        will be given the option to upgrade to a paid subscription. If
        Customer does not agree to continue use of the Tailscale

        Tailscale Solution.

        the Fees and institute new charges before a Renewal Term;
        provided, that Tailscale has given at least 30 days' notice
        thereof to Customer.

    8.4.  *Late Payment.* Without limiting Tailscale's other rights and
        remedies, if Customer does not pay any amount when due, then
        fifteen days after the day such payment was due (a) interest
        shall accrue on such undisputed amounts at 1.5% per month (or
        less, as per the maximum amount allowed by applicable
        law); (b) to the extent applicable, Customer shall pay any
        third party costs of collection (including, without
        limitation, reasonable attorneys' and professionals' fees);
        and (c) Tailscale may, upon notice, suspend Customer's access
        to the Tailscale Solution until such undisputed amounts are
        paid in full. To the extent Customer believes an amount
        charged or invoiced is incorrect, Customer must contact
        Tailscale within 30 days of receiving the relevant invoice or

        HST, personal property or other taxes. Customer will be
        responsible for and pay all applicable taxes, duties, tariffs,
        assessments, export and import fees or similar charges
        (including interest and penalties imposed thereon) on the
        transactions contemplated in connection with the Agreement,
        other than taxes based on the net income or profits of
        Tailscale. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
        Agreement, if any amounts (including any Taxes) are required
        to be withheld by Customer from any amount otherwise payable
        by Customer to or for the benefit of Tailscale under this
        Agreement, Customer will: (a) pay an additional amount such
        that the net amount actually received by Tailscale will, after
        all such withholdings (including any withholdings to be made
        in respect of any additional amount payable pursuant to this
        sentence), equal the full amount of the payment then due; (b)
        pay, or cause to be paid, to the relevant taxation authority
        the full amount of such withholdings (including the full
        amount of any withholdings in respect of any additional
        payment required to be paid pursuant to this sentence) in
        accordance with applicable law; and (c) furnish Tailscale as
        soon as practicable (and, in any event, within 30 days) with
        an official receipt (or a certified copy thereof) or such
        other documentation as is reasonably acceptable to Tailscale
        evidencing payment of such withholdings to the relevant
        taxation authority. In connection with this obligation,
        Customers that are not Canadian companies but that are subject
        to HST and/or GST must notify Tailscale in advance of making
        any payments hereunder.

    8.6.  *Suspension.* Any permitted suspension of the Tailscale Solution
        by Tailscale pursuant to the Agreement will not excuse
        Customer from its obligation to make payments under the
        Agreement.

        Recipient may disclose Discloser's Confidential
        Information: (i) to the extent that such disclosure is

        similar judicial or administrative body, provided that, except
        to the extent prohibited by law, the Recipient promptly
        notifies the Discloser in writing of such required disclosure
        and cooperates with the Discloser to seek an appropriate
        protective order; or (ii) to its legal counsel and other
        professional advisors if and to the extent such persons need

        business or assets of Tailscale.

    9.4.  *Injunctive Relief*. The Recipient acknowledges that disclosure
        of any Confidential Information by it except as set forth in
        Section 9.3 will give rise to irreparable injury to the
        Discloser or the owner of such information, not adequately
        compensated by damages. Accordingly, the Discloser will be
        entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and
        specific performance against the breach or threatened breach
        of the undertakings in this Section 9, in addition to any
        other legal remedies which may be available.

    9.5.  *Return or Destruction of Confidential Information*. Upon the
        termination or expiration of this Agreement each Party will
        promptly destroy (or, if requested by the other Party in
        writing, return) all Confidential Information (excluding any
        Personal Data, which will be governed by the DPA) of the other
        Party in its possession or control within a reasonable amount
        of time in accordance with the Recipient's data destruction
        practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may
        retain copies of the Confidential Information of the Discloser
        as required by applicable law, or to the extent such copies
        are electronically stored in accordance with the Recipient's
        standard backup procedures or record retention policies, so
        long as such Confidential Information remains subject to the
        confidentiality provisions set out in this Agreement. Each
        Party will protect any Confidential Information of the other
        Party in accordance with this Agreement so long as it retains
        such Confidential Information.

10. **Trial Features**
    From time to time, Tailscale may, in its sole discretion, invite 
    a Customer to use, on a trial basis, pre-release or beta products 
    or features that are in development and not yet available to all 
    Customers (each, a "**Trial Feature**"). All Customers invited to use 
    one or more Trial Features may use such Trial Features only for 
    internal evaluation purposes in a production environment, and not 
    for any commercial use. No fees shall be payable in connection 
    with the use of such Trial Features. The Trial Features, and all 
    associated conversations and materials relating thereto (including 
    any feedback received from Customer regarding the Trial Features), 
    will be considered Tailscale’s Confidential Information and subject 
    to the confidentiality provisions in this Agreement. Customer agrees 
    that it will not make any public statements or otherwise disclose 
    its use of the Trial Features without Tailscale’s prior written 
    consent. Further, Tailscale makes no representations or warranties 
    regarding the Trial Features. Tailscale may discontinue a Customer’s 
    access to any of the Trial Features at any time in its sole 
    discretion, with or without notice to Customer. In such event, 
    Customer shall immediately delete any data or other information it 
    has in its possession related to the Trial Feature. Tailscale may 
    decide not to release a final or commercial version of a Trial 
    Feature in its sole discretion and, if it offers a Trial Feature 
    commercially, may choose not to make it available to all Customers 
    who had access to it as a Trial Feature. In addition to the foregoing, 
    use of a Trial Feature may be subject to additional terms and 
    conditions that Tailscale makes available to Customer prior to 
    Customer’s use of such Trial Feature.

        will continue in effect for the initial term set out in the
        Order Form (the "**Initial Term**") or until otherwise

        Section. The Agreement with respect to the Tailscale Solution
        will automatically renew for successive renewal terms as set

        either Party provides the other Party with written notice of
        its intention not to renew at least 30 days prior to the end
        of the then current term or such other period as set out in an
        Order Form (collectively, the Initial Term and Renewal Term,
        the "**Term**").

    14.2.  *Termination for Convenience.* Tailscale may terminate the
        Agreement with respect to the Tailscale Solution or any Order
        Form at any time and for any reason without liability or
        penalty by providing at least 30 days advance written notice
        to Customer. In such event, Tailscale will refund to Customer,
        on a pro-rata basis, any unused subscription-based Fees
        prepaid under the Agreement for any period following the
        effective date of termination. Tailscale may terminate your
        right to use the Site at any point and for any reason in its
        discretion, and such termination shall be effective upon
        notice.

    14.3.  *Termination for Cause.* If you fail to comply with any
        provision of the Agreement, Tailscale may terminate the
        Agreement immediately and retain any fees previously paid by

        happy with the Service your sole remedy is to cease using the
        Service.

your contact information on file with Tailscale current at all times
during the Term.

16. **Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**

    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY -- IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

    16.1.  *Initial Dispute Resolution.* Our Customer Support Department is
    available via the Site to address any concerns you may have
    regarding the Service. Our Customer Support Department can resolve
    most concerns quickly to your satisfaction. The Parties shall use
    their best efforts through this Customer Service process to settle
    any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good
    faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party
    initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Failure to engage in this
    process could result in the award of fees against you in
    arbitration.

    16.2.  *Binding Arbitration.* If the Parties do not reach an agreed upon
    solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute
    resolution begins under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision,
    then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole
    means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below.
    Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to the
    Agreement (including their formation, performance and breach), the
    Parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the
    Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration
    administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its
    Streamlined Arbitration and Procedures, excluding any rules or
    procedures governing or permitting class or representative
    actions.\
    \
    Except as set forth in Section 16.5, the arbitrator, and not any
    federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
    authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to
    the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of
    the Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or
    any part of the Agreement are void or voidable, whether a claim is
    subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of
    JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of
    such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall
    be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a
    court under law or in equity. The Parties agree that the
    arbitrator may allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are
    likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The
    arbitrator's award shall be written, and binding on the Parties
    and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
    jurisdiction. No arbitration award or decision will have any
    preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with
    anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.\
    \
    The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be
    accessed at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267.
    If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, you
    will be required to pay US\$250 to initiate the arbitration. To
    the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of
    filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require Tailscale to pay the
    additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees
    unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide
    otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be
    non-frivolous, Tailscale will pay all of the actual filing and
    arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not
    exceed US\$75,000. For claims above US\$75,000, fees and costs
    will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The
    arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney's fees in certain
    cases.\
    \
    Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party
    must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the
    other party of the asserting party's identity, the claims being
    asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The
    arbitrator and/or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or
    counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The
    arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with
    JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be
    frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal
    Rule of Civil Procedure 11).\
    \
    The Parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or
    timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS's
    Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification
    does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to
    such fee modification. The Parties also agree that a good-faith
    challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not
    constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 16 while
    such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, and/or
    a court of competent jurisdiction.\
    \
    The Parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they
    would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They
    further understand that, in some instances, the costs of
    arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to
    discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

    16.3.  *Location.* If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration
    will take place at any reasonable location within the United
    States convenient for you. For residents outside of the United
    States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York,
    State of New York, United States of America, and you and Tailscale
    agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or
    state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel
    arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
    confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by
    the arbitrator.

    16.4.  *Class Action Waiver.* The Parties further agree that any
    arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only
    and not as a class action or other representative action, and the
    Parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek
    relief on a class basis. YOU AND TAILSCALE AGREE THAT EACH MAY
    BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
    CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
    CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If there is a final judicial
    determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this
    Paragraph's limitations as to a particular remedy, then that
    remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration
    and may be sought in court. The Parties agree, however, that any
    adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be
    stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.

    16.5.  *Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims
    Court Claims.* Notwithstanding the Parties\' decision to resolve
    all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action
    in state or federal court to protect its Intellectual Property
    Rights (but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may
    also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims
    court that are within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
    Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other
    equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding
    whether a party's claims are time-barred or may be brought in
    small claims court in your state and county of residence. Seeking
    such relief shall not waive a party's right to arbitration under
    the Agreement.

    16.6.  *30-Day Right to Opt Out.* You have the right to opt-out and not be
    bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set
    forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out
    to the following address: Tailscale Inc., 125-720 King St. West
    Suite 585 Toronto, ON M5V 3S5. The notice must be sent within 30
    days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be
    bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those
    paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions,
    Tailscale also will not be bound by them.

    16.7.  *Changes to this Section.* Tailscale will provide 30 days' notice of
    any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the
    30th day. If you continue to use the Site or the Tailscale
    Solution after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of
    which Tailscale does not have actual notice are subject to the
    revised clause.\
    \
    For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Tailscale agree
    to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue
    in the federal and state courts located in New York, NY. You
    further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby
    waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise
    available.\
    \
    The Terms and the relationship between you and Tailscale shall be
    governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to
    conflict of law provisions.

17. **General Information**

    17.1.  *Statute of Limitations.* You agree that regardless of any
        statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action

        Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or

        warranty that the Service may be exported without Customer

    17.4.  *Construction*. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement,
        the Parties' rights and remedies under the Agreement are

        equity or otherwise. The terms "include" and "including" mean,
        respectively, "include without limitation" and "including

        effect.

        employees), Internet service failures or delays, or the
        unavailability or modification by third parties of

        other corporate reorganization or a sale of all or
        substantially all of its assets relating to that portion of
        its business that delivers the Service. In this case, such
        assignee will have and may exercise all the rights, and will
        assume all of the obligations, of Tailscale under the
        Agreement, except that the assignment will not release
        Tailscale from liability for Tailscale's obligations under the
        Agreement. Except for such permitted assignment, neither Party
        may assign the Agreement or any rights or obligations under
        the Agreement without the prior written consent of each of the

        that of an independent contractor, and neither Party is an
        agent or partner of the other. Neither Party will have, and
