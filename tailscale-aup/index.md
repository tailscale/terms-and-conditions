### Our Vision

We’re returning to the original vision of the Internet. We want to help everyone create their own secure networks built around people and their connections. Similarly, we're fortunate to be able to play a part in enabling collaboration across the developer community every day, which is a responsibility we don’t take lightly. 

Together, we all have the exciting opportunity to make this a product and community we can all be proud of. That only works when we are all able to participate together in good faith. 

We are committed to making Tailscale the network that everyone, everywhere uses. That requires creating an environment that welcomes all the different voices and perspectives our customers, users, partners and community have to offer, while maintaining a safe place for everyone to participate and do their best work.
