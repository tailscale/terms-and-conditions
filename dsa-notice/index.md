The following information is provided pursuant to the EU Digital Services Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/2065) requirements for ‘mere conduit’ ‘intermediary services.’

representative. You can contact EDSR IE, in English or French, regarding matters pertaining
to the DSA:

### Tailscale and Your Content

Tailscale is designed so that only customers can encrypt and decrypt the information, data and content that they transmit using Tailscale (what we call “Traffic” in our customer agreements). Customers are solely responsible for the content of their Traffic. Tailscale has no general obligation to monitor, and does not monitor, Traffic. Any and all complaints regarding Traffic provided by users of the service (other than customer service inquiries in the normal course) will be routed to the Tailscale Legal team for handling.

### Transparency Reports

Tailscale does not engage in content moderation, because Tailscale has no access to any Traffic. To date, we have not received any orders subject to the EU Digital Services Act from EU Member States’ authorities.

### Single Point of Contact for Authorities and Customers in the EU

Any questions, comments or concerns may be directed to the Tailscale Legal team at legal@tailscale.com. All communications with our point of contact must be in the English language.

For general queries about Tailscale or help with your customer account, contact our support team at tailscale.com/contact/support.
