## Purchases through Resellers

Effective date: 2024-03-19

These terms apply to any access to the Tailscale Solution purchased by customers through an authorized reseller of the Tailscale Solution, a public or private offer on the AWS Marketplace, or similar (each a “**Reseller**”).

1. **Commercial Terms.** Instead of paying Tailscale directly, Customer will pay applicable amounts to Reseller as agreed between Customer and Reseller. Customer’s order details (such as the services purchased and associated fees) will be as stated in a quote, purchase order or similar document placed by Reseller with Tailscale on Customer’s behalf. Tailscale may suspend or terminate Customer’s rights to use the Tailscale Solution if it does not receive the corresponding payment from Reseller. If Customer is entitled to a refund under the Agreement, Tailscale will refund any applicable fees to Reseller and Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to Customer, unless otherwise specified.

2. **Relationship with Tailscale.** The Agreement is directly between Tailscale and Customer and governs all use of the Tailscale Solution by Customer. Resellers are not authorized to modify the Agreement or make any promises or commitments on Tailscale’s behalf, and Tailscale is not bound by any obligations to Customer other than as set forth in the Agreement. Tailscale is not party to (or responsible under) any separate agreement between Customer and Reseller and is not responsible for the Reseller’s acts, omissions, products or services. The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to Tailscale for Customer’s use of the Tailscale Solution will be deemed the amount paid or payable by Customer to Tailscale under the Agreement for purposes of limitations of liability.

## Plan Discounts

Effective date: 2024-03-19

These terms apply to all customers claiming eligibility for one of our discount programs applicable to not-for-profit and educational organizations and educational institutions.

### Plan Discount Eligibility

Our Plan discount programs have the following eligibility criteria:

- **Not-for-Profit Discount:** Not-for-profit entities or organizations that are designated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization in the United States (or international equivalent).
- **Education Discount:** Students and educators at accredited colleges, university, or other secondary schools or educational institutions, including without limitation community colleges, trade schools, professional schools, and post graduate programs. Limited to uses in an academic setting or for academic purposes that are authorized by your school (such as, for example, teaching work, or a student organization). Education technology companies are not eligible. Schools and programs for students who are under 18 years of age are not eligible.

Eligibility for a Plan discount is determined by Tailscale in our sole discretion. Applicants may be required to provide proof of eligibility.

### Representations, Warranties and Covenants

In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants in the Terms or MSA (as applicable to you), you further represent, warrant and covenant that:

- You meet the eligibility criteria associated with your Plan discount, and are able to provide proof if asked; and
- You will promptly notify Tailscale of any material changes to your status that may impact your eligibility for a Plan discount.

As a reminder, for education organizations based in the United States, Tailscale does not act as a “school official” as defined under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and similar state and federal laws, and you are solely responsible for using the Tailscale Solution only for non-FERPA covered purposes.

### Miscellaneous Terms

Limit one Plan discount per Tailscale account. Void where prohibited. Plan discounts may not be combined with any other offers, promotions or discounts. Tailscale reserves the right to modify any aspect of our Plan discounts, to increase or decrease the discount amount, to add or withdraw features or benefits, or to suspend or discontinue Plan discounts entirely (temporarily or permanently), at any time with or without notice in our sole discretion.
