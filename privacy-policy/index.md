## 1. SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY {id="scope-of-this-privacy-policy"}

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies where Tailscale is a “data controller” (under GDPR) or “business” (under California law) of your information. This includes when we collect information from and about visitors to our websites (“Site Visitors”), prospective users and customers (“Prospects”), community members who engage with Tailscale on GitHub, Reddit and other similar social media or developer sites or forums (“Community Members”), as well as users of the Tailscale Solution (“Users”), collectively referred to herein as “you.”

In providing our Services, we may process certain information about
Users on behalf of organizations that have contracted to use the
Tailscale Solution under a Main Service Agreement or Terms of Service
("Customers"). In such circumstances, our Customers are the data
controllers and we are the "data processor" or "service provider"
(depending on applicable law) as set forth in our [Data Processing Addendum](http://tailscale.com/dpa) with Customers. This means that our Customers are
responsible for processing information in accordance with their own
privacy policies and practices, and otherwise complying with applicable
data protection laws. When we act as a data processor, we will only
process information about Users using our Customers' accounts according
to the Customers' instructions and the applicable data processing
agreement we have in place with our Customers, or as otherwise required
by applicable law. In such circumstances, if you have any questions
about the processing of your information, or would like to make any
requests regarding your information, please contact your tailnet owner (the Customer) for
assistance.

## 2. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT {id="the-information-we-collect"}

Customers have the option, in their discretion, to use certain features
and functionalities through the Tailscale Solution that may generate
additional logs and other data that is sent to Tailscale for
processesing and storage on behalf of our Customers ("Customer Log
Data"). The Customer, and not Tailscale, is the data controller such
 Customer Log Data. Tailscale will process Customer
Log Data in accordance with our [Data Processing Addendum](http://tailscale.com/dpa)
with the Customer.

As you use the Services, we also collect aggregated usage statistics
(such as the amount of data transmitted through the Tailscale Solution
over a period of time, and information about how you're using the
Tailscale Solution). Please note that to the extent such aggregated
information or the metadata discussed above that we collect through your
use of the Tailscale Solution cannot be used to identify you or your
device, we can use and disclose such information in our discretion as
discussed in the "Aggregate/De-Identified" Information section below.

**Site Information**. When you use our Site, we automatically collect
certain information about your device and how you use the Site,

To collect Site information, we and our service providers may use
"cookies" or similar tools that track, measure, and analyze the
behaviors and usage patterns of our Site Visitors. Cookies are small
data files that can be stored on your browser and device so we can
recognize you when you return. We use cookies for analytics purposes, to
deliver certain features of the Site, to help us understand how users

From time to time, we may collect information about Prospects from other
sources, including partners, data enhancement services, conferences, and
other industry events or other purposes that we explain to you at the
time of collection, to the extent permitted by applicable law. We use
this information to supplement the information that we collect directly
from Prospects in order to better understand our Prospects' interests
and to provide them with more relevant information, and to improve our
analytics and advertising.

We may offer you the opportunity to engage with or log into the Services
using third-party social networking sites or other third-party
applications. When you log into the Services through these third-party
mechanisms, we may collect certain information associated with your

address, or profile picture), in accordance with your privacy settings
on those sites, in order to create and manage your account, or as part
of the operation of the third party's website, plug-in or application.
The third-party's privacy policy, and not ours, will govern the
information disclosed to us through the use of these log-in methods.

When you "like", "follow" or engage with us on GitHub, Reddit, LinkedIn, X or other
social media sites, we may collect some information from you including
your name, username, email address, and any comments or content you post
relevant to us.

We may use such information for any purpose, including without limitation developing and publishing information statistics, insights, industry trend reporting or thought leadership related to the Tailscale Solution, and may also disclose such data with any third parties, including our third-party partners.


## 4. LEGAL BASES FOR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION {id="legal-bases-for-use-of-your-information"}

The legal bases for using your information as set out in this Privacy
Policy are as follows:

-   Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or
    have entered into with you for the Services (e.g., the Tailscale Terms of Service)

-   Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
    third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
    override those interests (e.g., using information to secure our services, engage in analytics and product development, and for other internal business operations)

-   Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (e.g., where compelled by legal process to disclose information, or where we need to process information for tax and accounting purposes)


-   Where we have your consent to process your information in a certain
    way (e.g., when you attend a webinar and agree to receive news, emails or promotions from us)

## 5. SITE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING

**ANALYTICS** We may use third-party web analytics service providers on our Site to: collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent analytics service providers from using your information for analytics, please see our Cookie Notice for more information about managing cookies. If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.

**ONLINE ADVERTISING** In using the Site, we allow select third party
advertising technology partners to place cookies or other tracking
technologies on the browser of your device to collect information about
you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad
servers such as Google) may use this information to serve relevant
content and advertising to you as you browse the Internet, and access
their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your browser to
assist in this activity. If you are interested in more information about
these online advertising activities, and how you can generally control
cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising,
you may visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance of
Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/choices), [Network Advertising
Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
link](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/),
the [Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out
link](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/), or [Your Online
Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) to opt-out of
receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
programs.

We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company
chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible
for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. Please note that if you
use these mechanisms, you may still see advertising on the Internet, but
it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.

**DO NOT TRACK** Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in
certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful
choices about the information collected on our Services for third party
purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms
listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to
browser-initiated DNT signals.

Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the user “preference signal” referenced in the “Your Rights and Your Choices” section below, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your information for certain purposes (such as the “sale” of your information or the disclosure of your information for targeted advertising purposes) under applicable law.


## 6. HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION {id="how-we-disclose-your-information"}

We will disclose your information in the following ways:

-   **Service Providers.** We provide access to or disclose your information to select third parties who help us deliver our Services or perform services on our behalf, including billing and credit card verification, advertising and marketing (including third-party data lead generation or data enhancement providers that enhance our marketing and sales activities), content and features, analytics, research, customer support, data storage, security, web hosting, fraud prevention, and legal services.

-   **Affiliates and Subsidiaries.** We may disclose the information
    we collect within the Tailscale family of companies.

-   **Your Organization.** If you are a User using the Tailscale
    Solution under an organization's account, we may provide your
    information to the organization you are engaged or employed by in
    order to fulfill and enforce our services agreement with your
    organization, and to inform your organization regarding usage,
    support, or training needs.

-   **Protection of Tailscale and Others.** By using the Services, you
    acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain, and disclose the
    information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so
    by applicable law or in a good faith belief that such access,
    retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) enforce any
    contracts with you; (b) respond to claims that any content violates
    the rights of third parties; (c) protect the rights, property
    or personal safety of Tailscale, its agents and affiliates, its
    users and/or the public; and/or (d) comply with legal process (e.g. 
    a subpoena or court order).

    - **Canadian Law Enforcement Requests.**  We disclose your information
    solely in accordance with our Terms of Service and applicable law, 
    including the Canadian Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to the 
    extent it applies. Canadian law generally requires lawful authority 
    by means of a warrant issued by a judge to compel the disclosure of 
    User information.

    - **U.S. Law Enforcement Requests.**  We disclose your information 
    solely in accordance with our Terms of Service and applicable law, 
    including the federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Sections 
    2701-2712, to the extent it applies. In accordance with U.S. law:

        1. A jurisdictionally valid subpoena, issued in connection with
        an official criminal investigation, is required to compel the
        disclosure of basic User records, which may include name, length
        of service, credit card information (including billing address),
        email address(es), and an IP address, if available.

        1. A court order is required to compel the disclosure of certain
        records or other information related to a user account (not
        including contents of communications), which may include message
        headers and IP addresses, in addition to the basic User records
        identified above.

        1. A search warrant properly issued under the procedures described
        in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state
        warrant procedures, based on a showing of probable cause, is
        required to compel the disclosure of the stored contents of any
        account, including the contents of communications (e.g., messages
        and attachments). As noted above, Tailscale does not process, or
        have the ability to access, the content of User traffic data
        transmitted through the Tailscale Solution, which is fully
        end-to-end encrypted.

    - **International Law Enforcement Requests.** In the case of requests
    from law enforcement outside of the Canada and the U.S., a Mutual Legal 
    Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request or letter rogatory may be required
    to compel the disclosure of User data.

    - **Notification.** Tailscale’s policy is to notify Customers of law
    enforcement requests for their information, which includes a copy of
    the request, prior to disclosure, so that they may have an opportunity
    to challenge such request unless: (a) we are prohibited from doing so
    by law or court order; (b) there are exceptional circumstances, such as
    an emergency involving the risk of bodily injury or death to a person
    or group of people or potential harm to minors; or (c) prior notice
    would be counterproductive (for example, if we believe that the account
    in question has been hijacked).

-   **Business Transactions.** In accordance with applicable legal
    obligations, your information may be provided to third parties in
    connection with a merger or acquisition (including transfers made as
    part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part
    of Tailscale or our assets, or as part of a corporate reorganization
    or stock sale or other change in corporate control or fundamental
    business change, including for the purpose of determining whether to
    proceed or continue with such transaction or business relationship.

-   **Aggregate/De-Identified Information.** From time to time, we may
    disclose Aggregate/De-identified Information about use of the
    Services or our user base with partners and others, but such
    information will not identify you personally.

-   **Otherwise with Your Consent or at Your Direction.** In addition
    to the disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose
    information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or
    direct such disclosure.

## 7. RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION {id="retention-of-your-information"}

for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain

providing you with updates regarding our legal terms.

### YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

As explained above in the “How We Disclose Your Information” section, the disclosure of your information to certain advertising, analytics and enhancement service providers under applicable law may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the “processing”/“sharing” of personal information for online targeted advertising purposes.

## 9. THIRD PARTY LINKS AND FEATURES {id="third-party-links-and-features"}

The Services may contain links to third-party websites and features. If
you choose to visit these sites and use their services, please note that
we are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. The

Policy. We urge you to read the privacy policies of these third parties.

## 10. LOCATION OF PROCESSING {id="international-users"}

Your information is maintained and processed by us and our third-party service providers in Canada, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, and may also be maintained, processed, and stored in other jurisdictions that may have different data protection laws than those in your country of residence.

## 12. CALIFORNIA NOTICE {id="california-notice"}

If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with specific information regarding how we collect, use, and disclose your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).

### NOTICE AT COLLECTION

The CCPA requires us to provide you with certain information about:
1. The categories of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) that we collect;
2. The purposes for which we use each category of personal information;
3. The categories of third parties to which we disclose such personal information for a business purpose; and
4. The categories of third parties to which we disclose such personal information in a way that may constitute “sharing” of information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” and/or “selling” of information (each as defined under CCPA).

Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. Our use of certain third-party providers, which are described more fully in the “Site Analytics and Advertising” section above, may result in the disclosure of online identifiers (ex: cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” or "sharing" under the CCPA.

A chart with the information required by CCPA is available [here](https://info.tailscale.com/hubfs/CCPA-Notice-at-Collection-Disclosure.pdf).

In addition, throughout this Privacy Policy, we discuss in detail the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about you, information about your rights and our retention policies.

The California "Shine the Light" law gives residents of California the
right under certain circumstances to request information from us
regarding the manner in which we disclose certain categories of personal
information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties
for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal
information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
